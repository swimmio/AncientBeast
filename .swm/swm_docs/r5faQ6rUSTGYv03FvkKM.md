## Details
The combat locations are usually themed with one of the deadly sins and tend find themselves situated in one of the game realms described here https://ancientbeast.com/units/?view=dwellings in order to detail and reinforce them.
They're purely aesthetic, not influencing gameplay mechanics in any way.

## Specs
Their size is 1920 by 1080 pixels, provided in png format, final version being minimized usually using [tinypng](https://tinypng.com). The structure of the backgrounds is as follows: the top 1/3 of the image is the real background, showcasing some interesting scenery, but eye-catching details should not be positioned in the margins in order not to get overlapped by various UI elements, while the bottom 2/3 is basically a floor where the hexagonal grid and units are, so it should be walkable and designed in a way to not confuse players or distract too much from the actual gameplay.

You can see some screenies of various combat locations in action on our [screenshot gallery](https://ancientbeast.com/media/?type=screenshots#focus).

## Tools
We're using [Blender](https://blender.org), a free open source cross platform 3d modeling tool (and so much more) in order to create and render the backgrounds used in the game's combat. In case the scenes are fully 2d, then they can be done or assembled using image editors, such as [Gimp](https://gimp.org) or [Krita](https://krita.org).

If you need to see other examples, check the in-game versions of the existing ones on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/tree/master/assets/locations) or even dive into our [Mega art repo](https://mega.nz/#F!iUgjWY5B!PU8apR7b-efol0LI8VyssA), in `locations` folder, there's even a [template.blend](https://mega.nz/#!7conxCBD!yzUbevTLzkLzrtlYvvbWFtDyIEo8_tJljzJrK6SD8p0).

If you're working on a new location and want to see how it works with the current playable creatures, you can test out by importing their [cardboards](https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/tree/master/assets/units/cardboards) and placing them over using one of the tools.
