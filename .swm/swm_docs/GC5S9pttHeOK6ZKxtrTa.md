The units of these games are split into seven realms, based on the 7 Deadly Sins.
This document should focus on the sets with their essence and tendencies, for development purposes.

Avarice
=======
Located in the middle, consists of old cityscapes, with wrecked buildings and streets filled with anarchy.
The creatures here have a tendency of being most humanoid, use gadgets and are likely to acquire all sorts of useless things and riches by all means possible.

Summoners here have a tendency to avoid using plasma as much as possible, therefor there's a lot of focus on unit sustenance by shielding and healing.
Sets: city/sewer/industrial

Envy
====
This one is located in the West side and mainly consists of sand and stone. Night time makes a big difference around here.
Creatures living in this realm always feel rather insecure about themselves and they hate it when others are better in some ways.

There's a big tendency towards debuffing foes in order to diminish them.
Usually rather lonely and distant creatures.
Sets: desert/canyon/night
or cloth/shell/muscles

Gluttony
========
Located in the East side, where the jungles are really tall and wild, not even the sun's waves go through.
While deceptively empty, it's actually an overcrowded place where all sorts of beasts and plants eat each other as soon as they get a chance. Beware of the vegetation as well as don't pet any animals!
Sets: plant/animal/insect

Lust
====
North side. Volcanoes spread all across this land, which is usually covered by ashes, while rivers of hot magma run by, so beware your step and keep in mind that the air is rather toxic.
The creatures around here have a burning lust for destruction, incinerating everything within reach.
Sets: lava/metal/meat

Pride
=====
They're above everyone else. Literally at least.
Hundreds of years ago, some of the population, mainly the rich from the other realms, tried separating themselves from the rest, so they built all sorts of floating fortresses.

Creatures from this realm have abilities that let them easily go from one floating island to another and are usually colorful skin wise, which they tend to reveal quite a bit, but some prefer to wear masks in order to avoid anything happening to their pretty faces.
Sets: masked/crafty/enhanced

Sloth
=====
This Southern area is mainly water. The low temperature causes most of the water to freeze, providing a home for many of the creatures.
They don't bother to do much except survive.
Sets: snow/ice/aquatic

Wrath
=====
Underworld. Back in the day, there used to be secret underground facilities that were used for God forbidden experiments regarding genetics and bio weapons.
The beasts from this realm enjoy killing and inflicting suffering on others.

Big tendency for the creatures here to be blind or (un)dead.
Sets: bones/flesh/darkness
