### Recommended Tool

If you're not very keen on using a browser based IDE, I highly recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), for cloning the project and creating patches. [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is free, open source, cross platform, and has nice git integration and useful extensions.

### Fork Project

You can create a clone of the project by using git from the CLI or with the use of a tool like the one recommended above.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast.git
```

In [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) you can press `Ctrl + Shift + P`, search for `Git: Clone` and then input [just the link](https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast.git) in the given field.
