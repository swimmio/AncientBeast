This might get included on website Lore/Combat and could also serve as a script for an upcoming video tutorial for Youtube.

Ancient Beast is played 1vs1 or 2vs2, each player starting with a Dark Priest unit, that's both the weakest and strongest unit in the game at the same time, having an unique resource called plasma which is spent to materialize from a wide variety of units in order to protect himself or attack other players, while the remaining plasma points are used to shield himself against direct enemy attacks.

Summoned creatures differ greatly and vary in strengths and weaknesses, having unique stats and mastery points, as well as attacks and unique abilities.

A Dark Priest can only control a limited amount of units at the same time, so picking the right units is like picking the right tools for the job, as you'll have to counter the enemy picks while also making sure there's great synergy between the units in your party (summoned by you and even your allie) in order to maximize your chances for victory.
