The online multiplayer system uses [Nakama](https://heroiclabs.com), requiring users to register and log-in.

After doing so, eventually 3 games modes will be available, which will be described in detail below.

### Lobby
This game mode will require you to create or join an available room as you desire, where you'll be able to chat with the other participants (players and spectators), see the game settings and decide to play (ready up).
All the players will have access to the same units, there's basically nothing to gain or lose at all and no ways to tilt the match outcome, so it's the most fair way to play versus someone.

### Ranked
You'll search for games automatically, fighting players within your MMR range, so you'll earn or lose MMR and move along the ladder. Each month there will be prizes for top players.
This mode will have a small price tag of $3/month per unlocked unit set. This is in order to support development, also make players take the ranked more seriously and most importantly, to avoid malicious accounts or spam bots.

### Duel
This will allow players to battle each other for [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) crypto.

The idea is rather simple:
- players register for the game
- will need to confirm email addresses
- should eventually reach a certain involvement to cut down on the bots until having duels
- first player creates special duel type of match, placing an ETH amount on it by using [Metamask](https://metamask.io)
- second player is able to join that match by also using [Metamask](https://metamask.io), depositing the same amount
- the 1vs1 match takes place and the winner takes the overall sum, minus network gas fees
- project should either take a mandatory cut (10%) or just have that as suggested donation
